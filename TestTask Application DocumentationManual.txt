My Name is Ariyibi Elijah Ayomide, I am the developer/builer of TestTask Application.
Here are the documentation/manual or the application.

- Upon successful landing on the homepage.
- the user should navigate to "User" pane section by clicking,
- Upon successful landing to the User Index page, an empty/no record page would be shown.

To Test for the CRUD functionalities of this app
- The user should click on "Create New User" where there would be a redirection to the form page to fill out the necesaary informations.
- After filling all informations correctly, the user should click on create button on the form page. Successful clicking of this would redirect to the
index page showing the available users created.
_ By now, the user can have access to "Update" and "Delete" funcionality of the application.


This Application is capable of creating numerous/multiples users with full capability to update and delete.


Thank you.
